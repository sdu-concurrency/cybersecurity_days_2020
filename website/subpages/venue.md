### Directions

The University of Southern Denmark main campus can be reached by bus or by car.
In this page, you will find detailed instructions on how to reach the main location of the CyberSecurity Days.

Please, note that the main campus is formed by an extended number of buildings. If you get lost, just enter any University building: they are all connected, and there are maps on most main doors. You can also find your way by using the online map application available at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.sdu.dk">https://maps.sdu.dk</a>.

#### By Bus

If you are planning to use the public transportation system, there is a direct bus (lines 41, 42, and 44) from the centre of Odense (where the train/bus station is) to the University running at least every 30 minutes. The ride takes about 25 minutes.

Directions from the bus stop of the University Campus (<a target="_blank" href="https://clients.mapsindoors.com/sdu/573f26e4bc1f571b08094312/route/destination/563cb88d423b7d0540c99fc1">click here to see an interactive map of the path</a>):

- walk along the parking lot (P East) in the direction of the building with circles on its facade;  
- turn right at the first lane and enter the university building at entrance J/53; 
- walk all the corridor (Bogene) until it crosses the main hallway (Gydehutten);
- turn left and continue walking until you meet the intersection with the next corridor (Krogene);
- turn left and walk all the way to the end of the corridor (you will start finding roll-ups pointing the way);
- the BMB Seminar Room is the last room on the left (see the map at the end of the page).

#### By Car

If you are planning to use the car, we advise you to use the parking spaces at Fioniavej (P West) instead of parking lot near the Swimming Pool/Cortex Park (P East). There are far more parking spaces available at Fioniavej.

Experience tells us that from 9.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. there will be no available parking spaces at P East. Furthermore, the ongoing roadworks for the tramway increase the risk of traffic congestion at the intersection of Campusvej/Niels Bohrs Allé in the time periods: 7.30 a.m. - 8.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. – 4.30 p.m. The tailback can last up to 15-20 minutes.

To reach the BMB Seminar Room from the P East, please follow the instructions above, as the bus stop inside P East.

Instruction to reach the destination from Fioniavej (P West):

- walk down Fioniavej until it ends into an intersection;
- turn left and walk towards the University, until you reach entrance N36;
- enter the door and follow the roll-ups to the BMB Seminar Room.
