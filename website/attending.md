The Cybersecurity Days event will be held virtually. The presentations will be held on Zoom and you can access the conference at the following link <a href="https://syddanskuni.zoom.us/j/69612294019">https://syddanskuni.zoom.us/j/69612294019</a>. You are free to join and leave at any time.
 
For the network and social activities we will use the Gather.town platform available at  
<a href="https://gather.town/app/miuLA02wOyLnrPlo/cybersecuritydays">https://gather.town/app/miuLA02wOyLnrPlo/cybersecuritydays</a>. On Gather.town you will be able to speak with the CyberHub and the Center for Cybersecurity during the lunch breaks. You will also have a chance to chat with the other participants in the virtual lounge. Moreover, directly from the Gather.town platform, it is also possible to retrieve the link for the Zoom presentations by entering into the seminar room.

We kindly ask you to use your name on both platforms, possibly adding your affiliation (e.g., your company name, your university if you are student, ...). 

Hope to see you all on Zoom or Gather.town.
